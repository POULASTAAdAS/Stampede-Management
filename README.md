# <h1 align='center'>Stampede Management</h1>

## <h2 align='center'>Project Description</h2>

> Stampede Management is a crowd-monitoring and safety system that uses computer vision to detect, track, and analyze
> people in real-time to prevent overcrowding and potential stampede incidents. It combines YOLO object detection with
> DeepSORT tracking and provides live visualization, density analysis, and alerting.

## <h2 align='center'>üöÄ Features</h2>

* **Real-time person detection** (YOLOv8)
* **Multi-object tracking** (DeepSORT)
* **Crowd density & heatmaps** for zone analysis
* **Threshold-based alerts** (console, logs, or custom hooks)
* **Calibration tool** to map frame coordinates to ground plane
* **Video input and output** (file, webcam, RTSP)

---

## <h2 align='center'>üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack</h2>

* **Language:** Python 3.8+
* **Detection:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
* **Tracking:** DeepSORT
* **Core libs:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow

## <h2 align='center'>‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start (Windows PowerShell)</h2>

1. Clone & enter the repo:

    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
    cd "Stampede Management"
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3. Run the main script:

    ```powershell
    python PromisingTest.py
    ```

---

## <h2 align='center'>üñ±Ô∏è Usage Notes</h2>

* On first run the script will ask you to **click 4 ground points** on the frame (clockwise or counter-clockwise). These
  are used to compute homography for distance/density calculations.
* Press `q` (or the configured key) when calibration is complete.
* Use configuration variables at the top of the script (or a config file) to change thresholds, model paths, input
  sources, and output behavior.
